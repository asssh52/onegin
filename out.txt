Chapter One



          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
           Prince Vyazemsky

        I

     ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
     but when past joking he fell sick,
     he really forced one to admire him --
     and never played a shrewder trick.
     Let others learn from his example!
     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     sickroom attendance night and day
     and never stir a foot away!
               A-    -- - -b-  --  - - -   b  ----------------------------------nd the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     "When will the devil come for you?"''
     {35}

        II

     Such were a young rake's meditations --
     by will of Zeus, the high and just,
     the legatee of his relations --
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
     without preliminary feeler
     let me acquaint you on the nail
     with this the hero of my tale:
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     and bred upon the Neva's brink,
     where you were born as well, I think,
     reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     but I'm allergic to the North...1

        III

     After a fine career, his father
     had only debts on which to live.
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     promptly had nothing left to give.
     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     from her Monsieur took on the child.
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
     reluctant to exhaust the boy,
     treated his lessons as a ploy.
     No moralizing from this joker;
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     {36}

        IV

     But when the hour of youthful passion
     struck for Evgeny, with its play
     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     made London's dandy his professor.
     His hair was fashionably curled,
     and now at last he saw the World.
     In French Onegin had perfected
     proficiency to speak and write,
     in the mazurka he was light,
     his bow was wholly unaffected.
     The World found this enough to treat
     Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.

        V

     We all meandered through our schooling
     haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
     it's easy, without too much fooling,
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     Onegin was assessed by many
     (critical judges, strict as any)
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     Unforced, as conversation passed,
     he had the talent of saluting
     felicitously every theme,
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     while serious topics were disputing,
     or, with an epigram-surprise,
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     {37}

        VI

     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     the meaning of an epigraph,
     make Juvenal his text, or better
     add vale when he signed a letter;
     stumblingly call to mind he did
     two verses of the Aeneid.
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     for raking up historic dust
     or stirring annalistic must;
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     across the years to our own time.

        VII

     He was without that dithyrambic
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     and telling trochee from iambic
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     our deep economist had got
     the gift of recognizing what
     a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
     and how a country lives, and why
     it needs no gold if a supply
     of simple product supplements it.
     His father failed to understand
     and took a mortgage on his land.
     {38}

        VIII

     Evgeny's total store of knowledge
     I have no leisure to recall;
     where he was master of his college,
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     his young heyday's supreme employment,
     its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
     what occupied his chafing powers
     throughout the boredom of the hours --
     this was the science of that passion
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     condemned to a lifetime of hard,
     ended his wild career of fashion
     deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
     far, far from Italy, his adored.

        (IX,2) X

     How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     or pine, persuade of yes or no,
     and act the humble or imperious,
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     In languid silence, or the flame
     of eloquence, and just the same
     in casual letters of confession --
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     and self-oblivion was his art!
     How soft his glance, or at discretion
     how bold or bashful there, and here
     how brilliant with its instant tear!
     {39}

        XI

     How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
     startling the ingenuous with a jest,
     frightening with all despair's disguises,
     amusing, flattering with the best,
     stalking the momentary weakness,
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     swaying the artless, waiting on
     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     and listen for the heart's first sound,
     pursue his love -- and at one bound
     secure a secret assignation,
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     impart such lessons as you please!

        XII

     How early on he learnt to trouble
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,
     how well he knew the way to hurt --
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     But you, blest husbands, to the end
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     always contented with his life,
     and with his dinner, and his wife.
     {40}

        (XIII, XIV,) XV

     Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
     when little notes come on a tray.
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
     have each asked him to a soirée:
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     Which one comes first? It's just the same
     to do them all is easy game.
     Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
     complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     and there at large he goes patrolling
     until Bréguet's unsleeping chime
     advises him of dinner-time.

        XVI

     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
     his collar in its beaver braiding
     glitters with hoar-frost all about.
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     and truffles, which have ever been
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
     and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
     sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
     and ananas, the gold of trees.
     {41}

        XVII

     More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
     fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     the new ballet he should be at.
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     for the footlights, this fickle traitor
     to all the most adored actrices,
     this denizen of the coulisses
     that world where every man's a critic
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice
     to know the audience hears his voice.

        XVIII

     Enchanted land! There like a lampion
     that king of the satiric scene,
     Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
     and the derivative Knyazhnín:8
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
     with young Semyónova,9 and there
     our friend Katénin8 brought to bear
     once more Corneille's majestic story;
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     {42}

        XIX

     My goddesses! Where are you banished?
     lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     taken your place, though not your throne?
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
     again I see your soulful flight?
     shall my sad gaze no more alight
     on features known, but to that dreary,
     that alien scene must I now turn
     my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
     bored with hilarity, and weary,
     and yawn in silence at the stage
     as I recall a bygone age?

        XX

     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     and up the rustling curtain crawls.
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     bound where the magic bow will send her,
     Istómina,11 thronged all around
     by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
     twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     she's up and flying through the air
     like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     against each other swift, small feet.
     {43}

        XXI

     Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
     across the public's toes; he steers
     straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
     on unknown ladies in the tiers;
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     to gentlemen on every side
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     wanders in a distracted way
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''

        XXII

     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     outside and in they star the night;
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     but Eugene's out from din and press:
     by now he's driving home to dress.
     {44}

        XXIII

     Shall I depict with expert knowledge
     the cabinet behind the door
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
     Whatever for caprice of spending
     ingenious London has been sending
     across the Baltic in exchange
     for wood and tallow; all the range
     of useful objects that the curious
     Parisian taste invents for one --
     for friends of languor, or of fun,
     or for the modishly luxurious --
     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     adorned the sanctum of our sage.

        XXIV

     Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     such crystalled scents as best are able
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     as files, and scissors straight and curving,
     brushes on thirty different scales;
     brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
     Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     could not conceive how solemn Grimm13
     dared clean his nails in front of him,
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     shows freedom's advocate, that strong
     champion of rights, as in the wrong.
     {45}

        XXV

     A man who's active and incisive
     can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     custom is despot of mankind.
     Dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     giddy as Venus when she's mounting
     a masculine disguise to aid
     her progress at the masquerade.

        XXVI

     Your curiosity is burning
     to hear what latest modes require,
     and so, before the world of learning,
     I could describe here his attire;
     and though to do so would be daring,
     it's my profession; he was wearing --
     but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     I know (and seek your exculpation)
     that even so my wretched style
     already tends too much to smile
     on words of foreign derivation,
     though years ago I used to look
     at the Academic Diction-book.
     {46}

        XXVII

     That isn't our immediate worry:
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     Onegin has outrun us all.
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,
     along the street where slumber drowses,
     twin lamps of serried coupés throw
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     and radiate a rainbow: blazing
     with lampions studded all about
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     shadows that flit behind the glazing
     project in silhouette the tops
     of ladies and of freakish fops.

        XXVIII

     Up to the porch our hero's driven:
     in, past concierge, up marble stair
     flown like an arrow, then he's given
     a deft arrangement to his hair,
     and entered. Ballroom overflowing...
     and band already tired of blowing,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     and everything is cramped and loud;
     spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
     dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
     and on their captivating trail
     incendiary looks are slinking,
     while roar of violins contrives
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     {47}

        XXIX

     In days of carefree aspirations,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     the safest place for declarations,
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!
     I'm at your service to protect you;
     now pay attention, I beseech,
     and take due warning from my speech.
     You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     or else... or else, may God forfend it!
     I only write like this, you know,
     since I stopped sinning years ago.

        XXX

     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     I've wasted too much life away!
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     I'd still like dances to this day:
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     I love their feet -- though I confess
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     exists for me one special pair!
     one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     {48}

        XXXI

     Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
     madman, can you forget their print?
     my little feet, where have you vanished,
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you loved the opulent contact
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     Was it for you that I became
     long since unstirred by praise and fame
     and fatherland and grim confinement?
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.

line:176 Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
line:177 Eugene attends the boulevard,
line:178 Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
line:179 Eugene was free, and as a dresser
line:180 Evgeny's total store of knowledge
line:181 exists for me one special pair!
line:182 far, far from Italy, his adored.
line:183 Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
line:184 Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
line:185 felicitously every theme,
line:186 fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
line:187 flown like an arrow, then he's given
line:188 Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
line:189 for friends of languor, or of fun,
line:190 for raking up historic dust
line:191 for the footlights, this fickle traitor
line:192 for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
line:193 for wood and tallow; all the range
line:194 frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
line:195 Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
line:196 frightening with all despair's disguises,
line:197 from her Monsieur took on the child.
line:198 giddy as Venus when she's mounting
line:199 glitters with hoar-frost all about.
line:200 had only debts on which to live.
line:201 haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
line:202 have each asked him to a soirée:
line:203 have other maidens, since you vanished,
line:204 he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
line:205 He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
line:206 he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
line:207 He gave three balls a year, and rather
line:208 he had the talent of saluting
line:209 He lacked the slightest predilection
line:210 he'll spend before the looking-glass,
line:211 He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
line:212 he really forced one to admire him --
line:213 her progress at the masquerade.
line:214 he's bowed politely; his attention
line:215 he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
line:216 He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
line:217 He's off -- this ruthless legislator
line:218 he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
line:219 he's viewed the boxes without passion,
line:220 he turns away: ``I've had enough --
line:221 He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
line:222 He was without that dithyrambic
line:223 his bow was wholly unaffected.
line:224 his collar in its beaver braiding
line:225 His father failed to understand
line:226 His hair was fashionably curled,
line:227 his young heyday's supreme employment,
line:228 how bold or bashful there, and here
line:229 how brilliant with its instant tear!
line:230 How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
line:231 How early on he learnt to trouble
line:232 How soft his glance, or at discretion
line:233 How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
line:234 how well he knew the way to hurt --
line:235 I
line:236 I could describe here his attire;
line:237 I'd still like dances to this day:
line:238 I have no leisure to recall;

line:240 III
line:241 I know (and seek your exculpation)
line:242 I love their feet -- though I confess
line:243 I'm at your service to protect you;
line:244 impart such lessons as you please!
line:245 in Adam Smith was his diploma;
line:246 in casual letters of confession --
line:247 incendiary looks are slinking,
line:248 In days of carefree aspirations,
line:249 in fact a thorough fop, no less.
line:250 In French Onegin had perfected
line:251 ingenious London has been sending

line:257 Istómina,11 thronged all around
line:258 it needs no gold if a supply
line:259 it's easy, without too much fooling,
line:260 it's my profession; he was wearing --
line:261 its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
line:262 it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.

line:264 I've wasted too much life away!

line:268 let me acquaint you on the nail
line:269 Let others learn from his example!
line:270 like fluff before Aeolian breezes;

line:272 made London's dandy his professor.
line:273 madman, can you forget their print?
line:274 make Juvenal his text, or better
line:275 ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
line:276 Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
line:277 Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
line:278 More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
line:279 my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
line:280 My goddesses! Where are you banished?
line:281 my little feet, where have you vanished,
line:282 ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
line:283 No moralizing from this joker;
line:284 now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''
line:285 Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
line:286 now pay attention, I beseech,
line:287 Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
line:288 of eloquence, and just the same
line:289 of entertaining the half-dead:
line:290 of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
line:291 of jealousy, to seem to tremble
line:292 of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
line:293 of ladies and of freakish fops.
line:294 of listening like a judge-supreme
line:295 of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
line:296 of simple product supplements it.
line:297 of useful objects that the curious
line:298 Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
line:299 once more Corneille's majestic story;
line:300 Onegin has outrun us all.
line:301 Onegin knew enough to savour
line:302 Onegin, my good friend, was littered
line:303 Onegin was assessed by many
line:304 one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
line:305 one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
line:306 one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
line:307 on features known, but to that dreary,
line:308 on stage are thumping without cease;
line:309 on unknown ladies in the tiers;
line:310 on words of foreign derivation,
line:311 or else... or else, may God forfend it!
line:312 or for the modishly luxurious --
line:313 or pine, persuade of yes or no,
line:314 or stirring annalistic must;
line:315 or, with an epigram-surprise,
line:316 our deep economist had got
line:317 our friend Katénin8 brought to bear
line:318 outside and in they star the night;
line:319 Parisian taste invents for one --
line:320 Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
line:321 Prince Vyazemsky
line:322 proficiency to speak and write,
line:323 project in silhouette the tops
line:324 promptly had nothing left to give.

line:326 reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
line:327 reluctant to exhaust the boy,

line:329 Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
line:330 secure a secret assignation,
line:331 shadows that flit behind the glazing

line:339 sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
line:340 Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
line:341 spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
line:342 stalking the momentary weakness,
line:343 startling the ingenuous with a jest,
line:344 still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
line:345 still everywhere the lamps are bright;
line:346 Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
line:347 still shivering in the bitter weather
line:348 Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
line:349 straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
line:350 struck for Evgeny, with its play
line:351 stumblingly call to mind he did
line:352 such crystalled scents as best are able
line:353 Such were a young rake's meditations --
line:354 swaying the artless, waiting on
line:355 taken your place, though not your throne?
line:356 that alien scene must I now turn
line:357 that all of Russia can't contribute
line:358 that even so my wretched style
line:359 That isn't our immediate worry:
line:360 that king of the satiric scene,
line:361 that stretched from Romulus in his prime
line:362 that's where my years of youth were spent.
line:363 that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
line:364 that world where every man's a critic
line:365 the art he'd studied best of all,
line:366 the atmosphere of youth and madness,
line:367 the audience still is busy stamping,
line:368 the ballroom drove me off my head:
line:369 the barbs that envy's always spreading,
line:370 the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
line:371 the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
line:372 the cabinet behind the door
line:373 the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
line:374 the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
line:375 the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
line:376 the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
line:377 the gift of recognizing what
line:378 The happiness of youth is dead,
line:379 the heartache that they bring lies deep.
line:380 the heart of the professional flirt!
line:381 the horses fidget worse and worse;
line:382 The house is packed out; scintillating,
line:383 the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
line:384 their lords, and thwack their palms together;
line:385 the ladies' calculated dress;
line:386 the legatee of his relations --
line:387 the meaning of an epigraph,
line:388 then afterwards, alone, at ease,
line:389 the new ballet he should be at.
line:390 then from his cabinet he'll pass
line:391 then he'd implore a declaration,
line:392 then suddenly she's off, and there
line:393 Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
line:394 there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
line:395 there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
line:396 there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
line:397 There once I too strolled back and forth:
line:398 there, where the coulisse entrance went,
line:399 the safest place for declarations,
line:400 these words are not of Russian stock:
line:401 the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
line:402 the sumptuous palais shines out;
line:403 The World found this enough to treat
line:404 they all have richly earned a pension;''
line:405 this denizen of the coulisses
line:406 this was the science of that passion
line:407 though cold I am and sad; in sleep
line:408 though years ago I used to look
line:409 three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
line:410 Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
line:411 throughout the boredom of the hours --
line:412 to all the most adored actrices,
line:413 to do them all is easy game.
line:414 to drive the swooning senses mad;
line:415 to drown the hiss of modish wives.
line:416 to gentlemen on every side
line:417 to hear what latest modes require,
line:418 to hide a hope, to make a show
line:419 to know the audience hears his voice.
line:420 To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
line:421 to pass for cultured in our ranks.
line:422 treated his lessons as a ploy.
line:423 tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
line:424 twin lamps of serried coupés throw
line:425 twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
line:426 two verses of the Aeneid.

line:439 Whatever for caprice of spending
line:440 what flowers of spring display your dint?
line:441 What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
line:442 what occupied his chafing powers
line:443 what traps he'd set him, with what malice
line:444 when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
line:445 when little notes come on a tray.
line:446 When out to burst a rival's bubble,
line:447 "When will the devil come for you?"''

line:452 where you were born as well, I think,

line:456 while roar of violins contrives
line:457 while serious topics were disputing,
line:458 who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
line:459 why fight what's known to be decisive?
line:460 wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;

line:462 with combs, and steel utensils serving
line:463 with comedies of swarm and din;
line:464 with lampions studded all about

line:276 but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
line:277 these words are not of Russian stock:
line:278 where you were born as well, I think,
line:279 and bred upon the Neva's brink,
line:280 at the Academic Diction-book.
line:281 though years ago I used to look
line:282 a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
line:283 and then a stroll in Letny Park.
line:284 the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
line:285 and the majestic, antlered royal,
line:286 dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
line:287 let me acquaint you on the nail
line:288 and on their captivating trail
line:289 we'd better hasten to the ball,
line:290 I have no leisure to recall;
line:291 the art he'd studied best of all,
line:292 Onegin has outrun us all.
line:293 he really forced one to admire him --
line:294 ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
line:295 dared clean his nails in front of him,
line:296 and truffles, which have ever been
line:297 flown like an arrow, then he's given
line:298 Up to the porch our hero's driven:
line:299 with comedies of swarm and din;
line:300 there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
line:301 swaying the artless, waiting on
line:302 of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
line:303 he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
line:304 ended his wild career of fashion
line:305 Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
line:306 Enchanted land! There like a lampion
line:307 they all have richly earned a pension;''
line:308 But when the hour of youthful passion
line:309 this was the science of that passion
line:310 he's viewed the boxes without passion,
line:311 in casual letters of confession --
line:312 secure a secret assignation,
line:313 I know (and seek your exculpation)
line:314 then he'd implore a declaration,
line:315 on words of foreign derivation,
line:316 the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
line:317 Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
line:318 He lacked the slightest predilection
line:319 but groomed an anecdote-collection
line:320 How soft his glance, or at discretion
line:321 Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
line:322 at first Madame gave him tuition,
line:323 he's bowed politely; his attention
line:324 my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
line:325 that alien scene must I now turn
line:326 for friends of languor, or of fun,
line:327 since I stopped sinning years ago.
line:328 or pine, persuade of yes or no,
line:329 the heartache that they bring lies deep.
line:330 though cold I am and sad; in sleep
line:331 wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
line:332 he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
line:333 our friend Katénin8 brought to bear
line:334 how brilliant with its instant tear!
line:335 complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
line:336 bound where the magic bow will send her,
line:337 still shivering in the bitter weather
line:338 After a fine career, his father
line:339 He gave three balls a year, and rather
line:340 their lords, and thwack their palms together;
line:341 No moralizing from this joker;
line:342 without preliminary feeler
line:343 He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
line:344 Eugene was free, and as a dresser
line:345 make Juvenal his text, or better
line:346 add vale when he signed a letter;
line:347 Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
line:348 your chorus, is it dead for ever?

line:350 a deft arrangement to his hair,
line:351 exists for me one special pair!
line:352 in, past concierge, up marble stair
line:353 the cabinet behind the door
line:354 made London's dandy his professor.
line:355 He's off -- this ruthless legislator
line:356 for the footlights, this fickle traitor
line:357 Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
line:358 Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
line:359 Onegin knew enough to savour
line:360 to all the most adored actrices,
line:361 and ananas, the gold of trees.
line:362 brushes on thirty different scales;
line:363 twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
line:364 frightening with all despair's disguises,
line:365 straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
line:366 Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
line:367 the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
line:368 this denizen of the coulisses
line:369 Along the fronts of darkened houses,
line:370 What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
line:371 Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
line:372 along the street where slumber drowses,
line:373 To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
line:374 while roar of violins contrives
line:375 to drown the hiss of modish wives.
line:376 of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
line:377 like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
line:378 How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
line:379 haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
line:380 to pass for cultured in our ranks.
line:381 brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
line:382 the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
line:383 and up the rustling curtain crawls.
line:384 the legatee of his relations --
line:385 the safest place for declarations,
line:386 In days of carefree aspirations,
line:387 Such were a young rake's meditations --
line:388 of ladies and of freakish fops.
line:389 project in silhouette the tops
line:390 across the public's toes; he steers
line:391 on unknown ladies in the tiers;
line:392 what occupied his chafing powers
line:393 throughout the boredom of the hours --
line:394 he'll spend before the looking-glass,
line:395 then from his cabinet he'll pass
line:396 I love their feet -- though I confess
line:397 in fact a thorough fop, no less.
line:398 the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
line:399 the atmosphere of youth and madness,
line:400 with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
line:401 across our snows of northern bleakness
line:402 Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
line:403 stalking the momentary weakness,
line:404 the ladies' calculated dress;
line:405 by now he's driving home to dress.
line:406 Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
line:407 but Eugene's out from din and press:
line:408 and act the humble or imperious,
line:409 the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
line:410 of useful objects that the curious
line:411 or for the modishly luxurious --
line:412 the new ballet he should be at.
line:413 she'll spin this way and that, and beat
line:414 The World found this enough to treat
line:415 fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
line:416 the gift of recognizing what
line:417 you loved the opulent contact
line:418 against each other swift, small feet.
line:419 Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
line:420 across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
line:421 and watch your daughters closer yet,
line:422 shall my sad gaze no more alight
line:423 again I see your soulful flight?
line:424 in the mazurka he was light,
line:425 outside and in they star the night;
line:426 still everywhere the lamps are bright;
line:427 or else... or else, may God forfend it!

line:430 a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
line:431 of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
line:432 and fatherland and grim confinement?
line:433 its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
line:434 his young heyday's supreme employment,
line:435 that's where my years of youth were spent.
line:436 there, where the coulisse entrance went,
line:437 what flowers of spring display your dint?
line:438 madman, can you forget their print?
line:439 our deep economist had got
line:440 one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
line:441 and self-oblivion was his art!
line:442 the heart of the professional flirt!
line:443 how well he knew the way to hurt --
line:444 as well-read, though of pedant cast.
line:445 amusing, flattering with the best,
line:446 startling the ingenuous with a jest,
line:447 for raking up historic dust
line:448 as horses whirled him through the dust.

line:484 reluctant to exhaust the boy,

line:487 bored with hilarity, and weary,
